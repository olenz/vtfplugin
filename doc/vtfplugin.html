<h1>VMD trajectory/structure/coordinate format plugin</h1>

The plugin reads files written in the 
<a
href="http://espressowiki.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/wiki/index.php/VTF_trajectory/structure/coordinate_format">
VMD
trajectory/structure/coordinate format</a>. The format was designed
especially for VMD and is useful for hand-written simulation codes and
coarse-grained simulations. It is currently used by the <a
href="http://www.espresso.mpg.de/">ESPResSo</a> coarse-grained
simulation package.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>
<b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.
